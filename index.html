			<h3>About Care x Design</h3> 

			<p class="small"><a href="https://harvardx.design/" target="_blank">HarvardxDesign</a> is an annual conference launched in 2012 and led by students at the Harvard Graduate School of Design this year. We bring together creative thinkers, industry leaders, professors, and students to engage, debate, and reinterpret the design process across scales and sectors. Our goal is to share knowledge, tools, and resources that can empower creatives to become change agents through design.</p>

			<p class="small">Care is everything that is done to cultivate, maintain, and repair. This year, we aim to unearth the critical role of Care by Design in transforming society, organizations, and individuals ‚Äî it is in and through care that we design outcomes of meaning and connectivity. Confronted by the wear and tear of diverse systems and communities, we invite creatives to explore the fruits of unsung heroes and sow seeds of care through uncharted, emergent practices in design, health, policy, education, and the environment. Join us in reshaping our interpretations of care and be empowered to grow in gETures of humility.</p>
